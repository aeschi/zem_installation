## Abstract

**What was the whole project about, what did you archive...**

## Concept

The main concept for this project was to do an interactive installation, which concists of a wooden structure as projection surface. The projected visuals are abstract schools of fish. When the audience approaches the installation the fishes react according to the hand movement of the user. 
Through this installtion we want to bring attention to the human impact on marine ecosystem, in this case on coral reefs and it's inhabitants. This is also depicted in the form of the structure, which resemebles coral reefs, more specifically Acropora Hyacinthus coral plates. 

Human activities affect marine ecosystems as a result of pollution, overfishing, oil spills, and acidification, which lead to the extinction of marine species and have major effect on the biodiversity of marine life forms. The effect on the ecosystem can be noticed through the rapid worldwide decline in coral reefs. Coral reefs are the most diverse marine ecosystems on earth, giving shelter to thousands of animal species. They account for one-third of all biodiversity in the oceans and are vital to humanity. As a result of human influence, over [50 percent](http://www.secore.org/site/corals/detail/why-coral-reefs-need-our-help.23.html) of the worldâ€™s coral reefs have died in the last 30 years and up to 90 percent may die within the next century.

In this prototype the human influence on nature is represented through the hand interaction of the viewer, which leads to the movement of the fishes in the the opposite direction, giving an impression of fleeing. More complex forms of interaction are mention in section [Future work](#Future_Work). 

## Implementation

### Idea Development

From the very beginning it was clear to us that we wanted to address the topic of climate change or human impact on different ecosystems. For brainstorming and to make a list of resources we used [Miro board](https://miro.com) since it is excellent for getting an overview and all parties can edit the board. It helped us in finalising our concept as well as for resource management. After the intital brainstorming sesssion we decided on implementing visuals in TouchDesigner, since both of us wanted to get in touch with this tool. For the interaction we thought of using either Kinect or LeapMotion.

#### Concept sketch 

This is the first concept sketch we came up with. The idea was that the structure resembles coral plates and the interaction possibility is with the hand movements. We also wanted to use some sort of container with water to generate water refelection around the area of installation with the help of lights.

### Wooden Structure

We collaborated with **Marie Scharnagl** a capenter apprentice. With her we discussed about using different materials and decided to use MDF wooden boards for the structure for several reasons. It is for once cost-saving and we could use leftover material from Marie's workshop. Also, MDF is softer than other wooden materials, which is optimal for cutting the curves and digonal edges that we wanted. As mentioned above the plates are cut in the form of coral plates that are stacked on top of each other. We discussed different factors regarding the design, e.g how many plates we wanted to use, how they are distributed, waht size they have. We decided on using less plates but in bigger sizes so that we have a larger projection field which provides us with a continuous projection area. The distance in height between the plates was also an importatn aspect for the continuous projection and to avoid interruption. For the color we decided to use semi-glossy black paint to get a high contrast and enuough reflection for the projection.

#### First cut test

The first test plate can be seen in the figure below. We tested different aspects regarding the material, form, and thickness of the plate.

#### Assembly

After the paint was dry we assembled all the plates and mounted them on four table legs in order to get necessary height. For now we used non-adustable legs but in the future we would like to substitute it with telescope desk legs, so that the height of the structure can be adjusted accordingly.

### Projection Mapping

In order to get optimal visual results we tested the projection on different surfaces and color. The best results in terms of contrast and reflectivity we achieved were on dark surfaces, hence it was decided to paint the MDF boards in black semi-glossy paint. We also had to make sure that the projector had enough lumen since black surfaces require more light intensity. 

Below are the first test results on a darker surface for distance (1.1m distance for 50" projection) with Epson TW-650 projector.

### TouchDesigner

In order to get familiar with TouchDesigner we followed [several tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_WfldiO6HI&list=PLFrhecWXVn5862cxJgysq9PYSjLdfNiHz), that included working with different operators such as TOP, CHOP, SOP, MAT, DAT, and COMP. Different types of operators are used for different purposes and classes, for example, **TOPs** are texture operators and work with 2D imagery (pixels), videos, 2D shapes, and text. **CHOPs** are channel operators and work with data/signals. **SOPs** are surface operators and are used for 3D geometry. **MATs** are material operators and **DATs** are used for scripts, texts, and GLSL. Last but not least are COMP, they are a combination of several operators and include elements such as camera, light, animation, etc. 

Some of our results from the tutorials are as following:

#### Network

For this prototype we used different operators, for example for the shape of the fishes we used Sops operators, for scripting DAT, for redering and postprocessing we used Tops, for target position, movement, and for audio we used Chop operators. 

<img src="img/touchdesigner_nodes.png" width="900px">

The shape of one single fish is a simple sphere. We use a grid and a copy node in order to multiply the sphere to each vertice of the grid. Through this we get the inital number of sphere for the boids. For the behavoiur of the fishes we wrote a python script which is explained in [section Boid System](#Boid_System). The boids follow a target which is a sphere with random postion. This is achieved by using noise node for the trasform of the target sphere. The target is swtiched to the input from leap motion if there is an interaction. We use switch node for this and address it in the script. The sphere are rendered through render node. We used a simple phong material node for the shading. With the feedback node we generate soft trails so that the spheres look similar to fishes. In this first prototype we use a simple mask based on the outline of the coral structure in order to create boundaries. 

#### Boid_System

- formula
The Boids Rules
- Rule 1: Boids try to fly towards the centre of mass of neighbouring boids. (rule1 - cohesion - always travel towards center of group)
- Rule 2: Boids try to keep a small distance away from other objects (including other boids). (rule2 - avoid other boids)
- Rule 3: Boids try to match velocity with near boids.
- go towards target
- Limiting the speed
- Bounding the position

#### Movement of boids 

As mentioned above the boids follow a sphere that has moves randomly around the area. This effect is obtained by using noise node that is mapped to the transform position of the target. The target is sphere as long as the leap mOtion has no input. If the leap motion is connected the target switches to the users' hand. This functionality is implemented in the script. To get a smooth movement of the boids we used the math node for mapping the right values of the hand input to target's transform.

#### Boundarties for projection

Instead of using an external projection mapping software we decided to make a mask in TouchDesigner and use it as a projection area. The movement of the boids are restricted to this mask. The direction of movement changes if the fishes get closer to the boundaries. 

<img src="img/touchdesigner_mask.png" width="800px">

#### Interaction

The main interaction for this prototype is hand movement which influences the direction of the fishes. The user can steer the fish swarms by moving the hand sideways or forward/backwards. In touchDesigner we used the leap motion node to get leap motion input. It has several channels such as hand detection or each finger. For the prototype We decided to use finger input since the values for finger detection are more precise. We used select and math node to map the x axis and z axis values of the finger to the targer x and y position. Target is either random or if there is a leap motion input it's the finger position. The switch between the target is realized through switch node and python scripting.

<img src="img/tocuhdesigner_interaction.png" width="800px">

```python
	leap = op('leapmotion')[2]
	switchTarget = op('switch1')

	# if hand is detected switch target to hand
	if leap.eval() != 0:
		switchTarget.par.indexfirst = 1
		# invert direction on x axis
		target = np.array([-(targetOP[0].eval()),targetOP[1].eval(),targetOP[2].eval()])
	else:
		switchTarget.par.indexfirst = 0
		target = np.array([targetOP[0].eval(),targetOP[1].eval(),targetOP[2].eval()])
```

## Project Reflection & Discussion

What really worked well for this project was the team work. We distributed the workload accordingly and each team member had their specific tasks. Although, most of the time we worked together in solving issues or problems. So far, the coral structure is one part of the project that is furthest developed and is in the state as planned. Through this project we could gain basic knowledge in touchDesigner. We not only learned the basic components and functionality of touchDesigner but also what kind of projects can be implemented with it. However, we underestimated the time required to get to know touchDesigner. We invested a large amount of time in following tutorial and experimenting with different visuals. Initally we had planned to develop the project further than just a first prototype but this was not possible due to time constraints and hardware issues, e.g leap motion didn't work with windows due to SDK issues. 

### Future_Work 

Future goals for this project include having more organic and complex visuals for the fishes. We also want to add atmospheric particles to achieve the looks similar to an ecosystem with many organisms. Furthermore, we want to integrate not only ambient sound but also sound that reacts to the interaction and the movement of the fishes. As initially planned, we would also like to have water reflections in the room where the installation takes place in order to created underwater ambience. Regarding the interactivity we want to implement more complex forms of interaction. One idea would be to expand the hand interaction. Fish swarms would not only react to the hand movement but the movement would also generate an oil film like sustance that expands over the coral board. The fish would then decrease in vilocity according to the desity of the oil. The final results would then be fish swarms frozen in a dense sustance trasforming the installation from a vivid and dynamic looking environment to a still life. Through this we want to bring attention to the many oil spills occuring often in our oceans and endagering wildlife and are a threat to whole ecosystems. We want to emphesize this trasformation though the change of colors, starting with more organic colors and movig on to artificial (neon) color palette of the oil. 

Following are some images for the concept of the oil film.

## Lessons Learned

As mentioned above we underestimated the time needed for leaarning touchDesigner. TouchDesigner is a super powerful tool which can be used for a huge variety of applications. It has a complex structure of operators that requires time and experience to get proficient in. Never underestimate the time required to debug technical issues. We had some problems for instance with connecting the leap motion to windows. We learned that when planning on doing a physical installation it is good to collaborate with people who have an expertice in building wooden structures. It was great help having Marie in our team. So far this project has proven to be a good opportunity to learn touchDesigner, since both of us always wanted to get work with it. It was fun to work on a physical and interactive installation rather than just a software or digital project. As we've discoved before it is really helpful to work on a project in a team rather than alone because not only do we motivate each other but it's easier to overcome challenges and learn from each other.
