## Concept

Motivation, idea, vision, creative / artistic / technical concept

The main concept for this project was to do an interactive installation, which concists of a wooden structure as projection surface. The projected visuals are abstract schools of fish. When the audience approaches the installation the fishes react according to the hand movement of the user. 
Through this installtion we want to bring attention to the influence humans have on the environment, in this case on coral reefs and it's inhabitants. This is also depicted in the form of the structure, which resemebles coral reefs, more specifically Acropora Hyacinthus coral plates. 

In this prototype the human influence on nature is represented through the hand interaction of the viewer, which leads to the movement of the fishes in the the opposite direction, giving an impression of fleeing. More complex forms of interaction are mention in section [Future work](#Future_work).
